# Exercises

- This repository is just a backup of my solutions for some exercises I found at internet (specially at codewars)
- I put some explanation or different ways to solve one problem, just for fun

# How to run tests?

- I use `pytest` for this propose, but also I use `pyenv` to install dependencies easily

```zsh
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pytest IP-Validation/test.py # Just change the path for the test's path you want to run
```
